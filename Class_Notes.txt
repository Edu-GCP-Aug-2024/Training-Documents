	Cloud Platform :::
	
	Why Cloud Platform ?
	
		Launch a Website -> Web Application ->
		
		Resources! 
		
		Linux Machine --> Cloud Account -- GCP/AWS/Azure --> Linux Based VM
			-
			
		Online Training! --> LMS - Web Application 
		
		
		
		Dev the Web Application
		
		Build the Application
		
		Test the Application 
		
		Deploy to Production (Web Application(Target))
		
		Huge set of resources :
		
		Infra-Structure - Environments:
		
		Non-Prod Environments													Production Environments
		
			Dev Environment
			
			Build Environment
			
			Test Environments
			
				QA Environment
				UAT Environment		---> Staging/Pre-Prod Environment		---> 	Production Servers
				
				
		On-Premises Environments - requires a huge upfront investment 
		
		
		- GCP -->

		Non-Prod Environments													Production Environments
		
			Dev Environment	
				- Coding - Development Tools - GitHub 
			
			Build Environment
				- Application Build:
					- It is a process of compiling the source code & Create Artifacts
					
			
			Test Environments
			
				QA Environment		Artifacts
				UAT Environment		---> Staging/Pre-Prod Environment		---> 	Production Servers

		Deployment Package : *Artifacts 
		
			Application Should be Containerized!
			
			Containerization :
			
				- Is a process of Package the application(*artifacts) with all its dependencies
				
				Container Engine 
				
					Create Container Images 
					
					Create Containers 
					
				Kubernetes is a Container Orchestration Tool : Used deploy the Containerized Applications

	Virtual Machines :::
	
		- Virtual Machines are called as Hardware level virtualization.
		- VMs are used to run the Operating System
		- On top of ths operating system, Applications can be up and running.
		- Even if there is not Application, VM will still be running.
		
	Linux Operating System :::
	
		- Open-Source OS and It is reliable, Secured 
		
		Linux Distributions :::
	
			- Various Flavors of Linux :
			
				Package Manager :::
				
				Debian/Ubuntu			apt / apt-get		
				
				RHEL/Centos				yum 
				
				Fedora 					dnf
			
				
	- Created a VM
