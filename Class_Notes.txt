	Cloud Platform :::
	
	Why Cloud Platform ?
	
		Launch a Website -> Web Application ->
		
		Resources! 
		
		Linux Machine --> Cloud Account -- GCP/AWS/Azure --> Linux Based VM
			-
			
		Online Training! --> LMS - Web Application 
		
		
		
		Dev the Web Application
		
		Build the Application
		
		Test the Application 
		
		Deploy to Production (Web Application(Target))
		
		Huge set of resources :
		
		Infra-Structure - Environments:
		
		Non-Prod Environments													Production Environments
		
			Dev Environment
			
			Build Environment
			
			Test Environments
			
				QA Environment
				UAT Environment		---> Staging/Pre-Prod Environment		---> 	Production Servers
				
				
		On-Premises Environments - requires a huge upfront investment 
		
		
		- GCP -->

			lakhs of use cases and test scenarios 
		
		Functions :
		
		sign-up			--> Micro-Service1	-> Developer - Independently Designed/developed/Tested/Implemented to Prod.
		sign-in			--> Micro-Service2 
		search 
		add to cart 
		place the order 
		make payment 
		confirm
		track

		External Storage :
		
			Persistant Volumes 
		
		
	
	Various methods to interact with GC Services
		
		- GC Console to explore the GC Services 

		- GCloud Shell -- Through Web Browser 		
			gcloud cli commands to access the resource 
	
		- gcloud API Services 
		
		- gcloud sdk - software development kit 
		
		- IAC Tools - Infra-Structure As Code -> 
				- Terraform

		Non-Prod Environments													Production Environments
		
			Dev Environment	
				- Coding - Development Tools - GitHub 
			
			Build Environment
				- Application Build:
					- It is a process of compiling the source code & Create Artifacts
					
			
			Test Environments
			
				QA Environment		Artifacts
				UAT Environment		---> Staging/Pre-Prod Environment		---> 	Production Servers

		Deployment Package : *Artifacts 
		
			Application Should be Containerized!
			
			Containerization :
			
				- Is a process of Package the application(*artifacts) with all its dependencies
				
				Container Engine 
				
					Create Container Images 
					
					Create Containers 
					
				Kubernetes is a Container Orchestration Tool : Used deploy the Containerized Applications
					- Auto-scaling --> scale-up/down 
					- Load-Balancing 
					- Self Healing 
					
					20 Prod Servers! +++
